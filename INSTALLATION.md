# Dekode Project Base

Dekode Project Base is based on Bedrock, a modern WordPress stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project structure.
Much of the philosophy behind Bedrock is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology including the [WordPress specific version](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.0
* Composer - [Install](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
* Node >= 14.0

## TLDR - what's new in ver 2.0?
Themes, plugins, mu-plugins etc. is now structured under packages and built into the wordpress structure by composer. All build scripts are run from root and automatically looks through `./packages`. Packages need an `entry-files.json` file to define what files should be build when running npm build/start and a `composer.json` that defines what it is and gives the package a name. Codeship testing/build commands are now located in the repository under `./tools`. Any time a new package is added it needs to be referenced in the project-base root composer.json using @dev.

## Structure

- Packages
 Contains all of the code developed for the project such as plugins, themes, mu-plugins and any custom libs etc. This gets built into and symlinked into public by composer.
- Public
 The files used by WordPress. Contents are generated automatically from packages using composer.
- Tools
 Build and setup scripts used by Codeship and Local
- Config
 Environment variable setup

## Local setup
1. If setting up a new project, create a git repo using [Project base]https://github.com/DekodeInteraktiv/project-base as the template. Otherwise skip this step.
2. Create a new site in Local by Flywheel
3. Follow one of the methods below (not both!)

### Method 1 - Setup replicating server structure
4. Update environment variables in `./config/development.php`  file:
  * `DB_NAME` - Database name
  * `DB_USER` - Database user
  * `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
  * `DB_HOST` - Database host
  * `WP_ENV` - Set to environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
  * `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (http://example.com)
  * `WP_SITEURL` - Full URL to WordPress including subdirectory (http://example.com/wp)
  * `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, `LOGGED_IN_KEY`, `NONCE_KEY`, `AUTH_SALT`, `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, `LOGGED_IN_SALT`, `NONCE_SALT`

  If you want to automatically generate the security keys (assuming you have wp-cli installed locally) you can use the very handy [wp-cli-dotenv-command][wp-cli-dotenv]:

      wp package install aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command

      wp dotenv salts regenerate

  Or, you can cut and paste from the [Roots WordPress Salt Generator][roots-wp-salt].

5. `cd` to the site app folder and `rm -rf public` to remove the `/public` folder automatically generated by Local.
6. Clone the existing project (or the one you setup on step 1) from github. to the site app folder, name the project folder `public`.
7. Restart the site in Local.
8. Run the scripts in `./tools/local/`

### Method 2 -Setup using Local structure (symlink method)

4. `cd` to the site app folder and clone the existing project (or the one you setup on step 1) from github.
5. `cd` into public and remove wp-content `rm -rf wp-content`
6. create a symlink in public from `wp-content` to `../{project folder}/public/content`
7. Run the scripts in `./tools/local/`

### Installation and build
Run `composer install` and `npm install && npm run build` in root to build the project.
